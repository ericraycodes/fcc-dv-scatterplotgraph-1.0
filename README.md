# Concept

## About
Graph data of top 35 fastest bicycle racing record - in particular, through a scatterplot of about three informations:
 1. **Year** - the *x-axis*, of the race.
 1. Time in **minutes** - *y-axis*, the cyclist finished the race.
 1. **Doping** allegation - in *color*, of the cyclist on that race.

## Logic
 1. The D3 must load through cdn link.
 1. Request the dataset through XMR.
 1. Scatter plot the data with D3.
